                <p>A browser interprets HTML in order to display many forms of multimedia. Ex: graphics, text, videos,
                    movies and animation. It contains interactivity through the use of hypermedia and hypertext which
                    will display different elements. </p>
                <p> The first web browser was made by netscape. It was called Mozilla.</p>
                <p>Common web browsers include:</p>
                <li>Chrome</li>
                <li>Internet explorer</li>
                <li>Firefox</li>
                <li>Safari</li>
                <li> Opera </li>
                <br>
                <p><b>What is the difference between a web browser and a search engine?</b></p>
                <p>A web browser is a software application used to retrieve data from webpages, whereas, Search Engine
                    is kind of a website where a user can search for information and the results based on the same are
                    displayed on the screen.</p>

                <h4 class="text-warning" id="Search Engine">Search Engine</h4>
                <p>A search engine is software accessed on the Internet that searches a database of information
                    according to the user's query. The engine provides a list of results that best match what the user
                    is trying to find. Today, there are many different search engines available on the Internet, each
                    with its own abilities and features. The first search engine ever developed is considered Archie,
                    which was used to search for FTP files, and the first text-based search engine is considered
                    Veronica. Currently, the most popular and well-known search engine is Google. Other popular search
                    engines include AOL, Ask.com, Baidu, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo.</p>

                <p><b>What is a website cookie?</b></p>
                <p>Website cookies are small text files, created when a user visits a website and stored on the user’s
                    browser. Cookies are unique to each user, and allow websites to customize browsing sessions for each
                    visit. Many of the best website builders have built-in cookie functions that let you do things like
                    remember user preferences, manage their shopping carts, and other useful, customer-focused features.
                </p>
                <p><b>What does a website cookie do?</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manage current browsing session.</li>
                    <li>Manage persistent preferences across multiple browsing sessions</li>
                    <li>Tracking user behavior</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p><b>Why Cookies Can Be Dangerous?</b></p>
                <p>Since the data in cookies doesn't change, cookies themselves aren't harmful.

                    They can't infect computers with viruses or other malware. However, some cyberattacks can hijack
                    cookies and enable access to your browsing sessions.

                    The danger lies in their ability to track individuals' browsing histories. To explain, let’s discuss
                    what cookies to watch out for.</p>

                <h4 class="text-info" id="Firewall">Firewall</h4>
                <p><b>What is a firewall?</b></p>
                <p>A firewall is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic and
                    permits or blocks data packets based on a set of security rules. Its purpose is to establish a
                    barrier between your internal network and incoming traffic from external sources (such as the
                    internet) in order to block malicious traffic like viruses and hackers.</p>
                <p><b>Firewalls carefully analyze incoming traffic based on pre-established rules and filter traffic
                        coming from unsecured or suspicious sources to prevent attacks. Firewalls guard traffic at a
                        computer’s entry point, called ports, which is where information is exchanged with external
                        devices. For example, “Source address 172.18.1.1 is allowed to reach destination 172.18.2.1 over
                        port 22."</b></p>

                <p><b> Think of IP addresses as houses, and port numbers as rooms within the house. Only trusted people
                        (source addresses) are allowed to enter the house (destination address) at all—then it’s further
                        filtered so that people within the house are only allowed to access certain rooms (destination
                        ports), depending on if they're the owner, a child, or a guest. The owner is allowed to any room
                        (any port), while children and guests are allowed into a certain set of rooms (specific
                        ports).</b></p>

                <h4 class="text-muted" id="Packet">Packet</h4>
                <p><b>What is a Packet?</b></p>
                <p>In networking, a packet is a small segment of a larger message. Data sent over computer networks*,
                    such as the Internet, is divided into packets. These packets are then recombined by the computer or
                    device that receives them.</p>
                <p>Suppose Alice is writing a letter to Bob, but Bob's mail slot is only wide enough to accept envelopes
                    the size of a small index card. Instead of writing her letter on normal paper and then trying to
                    stuff it through the mail slot, Alice divides her letter into much shorter sections, each a few
                    words long, and writes these sections out on index cards. She delivers the group of cards to Bob,
                    who puts them in order to read the whole message.</p>

                <p> This is similar to how packets work on the Internet. Suppose a user needs to load an image. The
                    image file does not go from a web server to the user's computer in one piece. Instead, it is broken
                    down into packets of data, sent over the wires, cables, and radio waves of the Internet, and then
                    reassembled by the user's computer into the original photo.</p>

                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <h4 class="text-primary" id="Protocol">Protocol</h4>
                <p>In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are
                    like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different
                    software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other
                    regardless.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Standardized protocols are like a common language that computers can use, similar to how two people
                    from different parts of the world may not understand each other's native languages, but they can
                    communicate using a shared third language. If one computer uses the Internet Protocol (IP) and a
                    second computer does as well, they will be able to communicate — just as the United Nations relies
                    on its 6 official languages to communicate amongst representatives from all over the globe. But if
                    one computer uses IP and the other does not know this protocol, they will be unable to communicate.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p> On the Internet, there are different protocols for different types of processes. Protocols are often
                    discussed in terms of which OSI model layer they belong to.</p>
